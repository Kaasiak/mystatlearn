# Elements of Statistical Learning

`mystatlearn` is a Python package for statistical learning. It accompanies my journey with *The Elements of Statistical Learning* 
book by Jerome H. Friedman Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie.  The package contains examples of algorithms for regression, 
classification, smoothing, filtering, etc. with a focus on clarity and readability rather than computational efficiency. 

The repository also contains a range of jupyter notebooks showcasing simple application of the algorithms implemented in `mystatlearn`.
Many examples and data sets are drawn from [1].
